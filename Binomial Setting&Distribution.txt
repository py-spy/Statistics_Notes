Binomial Setting:
If you read a question and each trial has only 2 outcomes
(pass/fail, heads/tails), you could have a binomial setting

1. Each obsevation is either success or failure
2.There is a fixed number 'n' observations
3. All observations are independent
4. The probability of success is constant

When determing if there is a binomial setting, the independence check
can be tricky. If the population is 10 times greater than the sample
sizwe, you can assume there is independence in a random selection.

Binomial Distribution: It is a type of discrete random variable

1. X is defined as number of success
2. n trials
3. p probability of success

X can take on whole number values between 0 and n with
a distribution of B(n,P)

How many ways can you have 'k' success out of 'n' observations
Binomial Coefficient = n!/k!(n-k)!

What is teh probability of observing 'k' successes from n observations

Binomial Probability : binomial coeffecient(p^k)[(1-p)^ n-k] =
n!/k!(n-k)!(p^k)[(1-p)^ n-k]
