Sample Means:
If you are analyzing multiple observations and each one has more
than just two outcomes(like pass/fail, yes/no), then you may be
setting up a sample mean variable, like gpa, blood pressure, shoe 
size etc.

Means of random samples are less variable than indivivdual 
observations

The Central Limit Theorem explains how the distribution of
means are more normal than the individual observations.

Checks for working with Means

1. Random selection from SRS
2. Independent observation (pop must be 10 times > sample)
3, Normality, Stated or due to Central Limit Theorem

Required Size of samples(n) for Central Limit Theorem to ensure 
Normality for the distribution of averages

n<15 for raw data that is approx normal
15 <= n <= 30 if raw data has no outliers or strong skewness
n>=30 if data has outliers or strong skewness
